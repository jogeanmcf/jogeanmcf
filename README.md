I am focused, passionate about programming and science. I have an academic background being bachelor, master and acquiring my PhD in physics. At the time I was focused on theoretical physics, and in the meanwhile I devoted myself to learning the main programming languages out there. Python felt natural, where I learned the main tools for Data Science and where my math/physics skills can be well applied. Also I like front-end development, where part of my free time was devoted to learning JavaScript (and frameworks related) + Flutter.
